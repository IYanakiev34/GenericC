# Generic Data Structures and Algorithms in C
Hey all, this is my take on creating generic structures and algorithms
in C. Keep in mind this is probably not the best way to do it. There might be
mistakes. I will try to keep the code clean, documented, and tested.
I will start by implementing the most common and basic structures and will move on
to some algorithms then and even thread-safe versions. I take inspiration
from the interfaces of the C++ STL. The documentation can be viewed after generating
with doxygen.
